# Description
Ever wanted to add Java Editions achievements to your [PocketMine-MP](https://pmmp.io) server for whatever reason? 

Well I got you covered because this plugin adds in some of the Java Editions achievements!

Note: Some achievements have been left out due to pmmp limitations such as; Taking Inventory, Delicious Fish, On A Rail, Monster Hunter, Cow Tipper, When Pigs Fly, Sniper Duel, Into The Nether, Return to Sender, Into Fire, Local Brewery, The End?, The End, Adventuring Time, The Beginning?, The Beginning. and The Beaconator.

**I will add more legacy achievements once pmmp adds new features.**
